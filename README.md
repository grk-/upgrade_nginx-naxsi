# upgrade_nginx-naxsi

This script is a very basic way to install/upgrade nginx with naxsi WAF module, from sources.

They are several things I would like to implement :

- Automagically fetch latest stable Nginx: eg html parsing :(
- Check integrity of nginx src using gpg
- Add lua support for Nginx (check for local lua interpreter and fetch nginx lua mode)

Any help is welcome !
